                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Anandwan ("Forest of Joy") was established in 1949 by Baba Amte, a lawyer turned social worker who dedicated his life to serving those afflicted with leprosy. Starting with just a few acres of barren land and a handful of patients who were rejected by society, Baba Amte created a self-sufficient community where those affected by leprosy could live with dignity.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, Anandwan has grown into a thriving community with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A modern hospital with dedicated leprosy treatment facilities</li>
                        <li>Rehabilitation centers for physical therapy and occupational training</li>
                        <li>Schools and vocational training programs</li>
                        <li>Sustainable agriculture and cottage industries</li>
                        <li>Cultural and artistic activities</li>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Anandwan's mission is to provide comprehensive care to people affected by leprosy through:</p>

                        <li><strong>Physical rehabilitation:</strong> Specialized care to minimize and manage disabilities</li>
                        <li><strong>Social and economic rehabilitation:</strong> Training programs and employment opportunities to restore dignity and self-reliance</li>

                    <h2>Our Approach to Leprosy Treatment</h2>
                    <p>Leprosy (Hansen's disease) is a chronic infectious disease caused by <em>Mycobacterium leprae</em>. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="mt-4">Treatment Regimen</h5>
                    <p>We follow the World Health Organization's Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT) protocol:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Paucibacillary (PB) leprosy:</strong> 6 months of treatment with two drugs (rifampicin and dapsone)</li>
                        <li><strong>Multibacillary (MB) leprosy:</strong> 12 months of treatment with three drugs (rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5 class="mt-4">Disability Prevention</h5>
                    <p>Our approach includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Regular nerve function assessment</li>
                        <li>Early intervention for reactions and neuritis</li>
                        <li>Self-care training for patients</li>
                        <li>Protective footwear and adaptive devices</li>
                        <li>Physical therapy and wound care</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5 class="mt-4">Holistic Care</h5>
                    <p>Beyond medical treatment, we provide:</p>
